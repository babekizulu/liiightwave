          From the Founding of LiiiGHTWAVE, we have undertook to hold ourselves

          seriously, and will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against
          any member of the company who is found to be in violation of our

          both in the workplace, and in our dealings outside of the workplace,
          and in the provision of our services and customer support to our end
